# Tic-Tac-Toe with Unbeatable AI

A classic two-player game of Tic-Tac-Toe, powered by an unbeatable AI opponent. This game was developed in C++ and implements a min-max algorithm to make the AI's moves.

## Key Features

    Play against an unbeatable AI opponent
    User-friendly interface
    Fast and efficient implementation in C++
    Built-in min-max algorithm for AI's optimal moves

## How it Works

The AI opponent uses the min-max algorithm to analyze all possible outcomes of each turn, ensuring it never loses the game. The algorithm evaluates the best move by maximizing its own score and minimizing the score of the player. The AI always makes the move that leads to the best possible outcome for itself.
